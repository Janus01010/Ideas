The dream of liberalism is: "create an infrastructure of respect towards the rights and rationality of man,
and you will create a just and rational society". This is a universal perscription: for every man and woman.

It is also naive. In daily life, the thinking man or woman meets a number of other human beings who do not
have the mental capacities, nor interest, in allowing their rights or rationality to be respected. We all have
the primal, animalist desires and responses in our brains, but few can tend to those desires effectively.

Few are capable of broad, universalist thinking, thinking which is necessary for the liberal dream to become reality.

In this sense, the movements of Lenin, Stalin, Mao, etc., were quite conservative as the ignorance and "lead-ability"
of the masses were assumed. They had to be guided by the more intelligent. Liberalism itself is only *for* a specific portion
of the population which can understand and enjoy its positions and consequences.

We know how all of that ended. The solution is not dictatorship, as power resting on just one person can be just as destructive
as the masses leading. What is needed is something altogether more moderate: the curbing of power of most individuals,
save for a group which has disproportionately more power than the most. How those people are chosen to be a part of that
aristocracy is a tricky and imperfect one, but it seems that capitalism is one of the most useful tools to find that equilibrium.

Perhaps the big issue of capitalism comes when it is treated mainly as a method of speculation rather than power/social organizing,
but that is for another time.
