**WHAT**

For those interested in the LGBTQ+ phenomenon, I recommend looking at (https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/LGBTA_Wiki)
and looking at the list of genders and the lists of lists of genders that they have. 
You have ones like Arsongender who have a "burn it all down" attitude towards gender and don't see themselves
as anything. You also have Aguaboys who are masculine though have some interest or connection with water.

The issue with the gender debates that are so popular now is that it puts you in the position of 
condemning or activism, but that misses the analysis of what's really going on here.

For most of human thought (I assume), gender was associated with the relationship one has with their biology
and interacting with the social expectations of their biology. Before, if you had a vagina, you were to be 
treated in certain socially proscribed ways regardless of how you felt "inside". Today, it's the opposite.
We proscribe society to expect what we want to be expected for. In other words, we want society to 
agree with us about how we see ourselves. A dramatic shift to be sure.

If I see myself as a woman, I want others to see, hear, listen, respond, etc. to me as such as well. This
assumes a shared definition of "woman". In fact, one might criticize this desire. One can easily say 
"Why are you falling under the trappings of being a woman? Those are antiquated!". Indeed, a portion
of our society has heard that call, and the result--I claim--is the huge list of genders we see today.

I argue that gender has gone through a change in definition. Before, it was about society's reaction
towards your inner self and your outside self. Today, gender is used to refer to our desires about
how we want others, especially strangers, to see us, what to expect from us, and how to act towards us.
Biology, or anything "out there" outside our internal space has nothing really to do with this. At most,
the outside is the salad dressing to the salad. The body is used as a form of expression towards what is
inside.

Importantly, what is inside does not have to refer to anything sexual. Political, aesthetic preferences,
pagan predilictions, etc. can all now be categorized and labeled. Rather than explaining someone how much
I enjoy being in nature and how connected I am to the trees of the forest, I can instead just 
call myself an Ipinean. Assuming you know what an ipinean is, you know much about what is important to me, 
what type of person I am, etc. with that shorthand.

**WHY**

Why did this change happen? Multiple reasons.

For one, it's an expression of the contemporary (and evolutionary) compulsion towards increasing options.
Today, there are seemingly endless options everywhere. We buy services not because we're going to enjoy 
everything they give us, but because we know there's a huge amount that we WON'T see! If a service 
is filled ONLY with what is good quality, we will not be satisfied. After all, what if we watch everything
that is good!? We have endless choices on what we watch, eat, who we will talk to, who we'll have sex with, etc.
Why not have a similar amount of options with our identities?

Secondly, it's a manifestation of taxonomy and naming of novel distinctions which, arguably, has allowed 
our civilization to go as far (or, depending on who you ask, *behind*) as it has. We understand different
diseases, different parts of our genome, different parts of history, etc. by constantly comparing them with others
and drawing novel conclusions based on those comparisons. Why not do it to gender as well? 
Of course, there's also the human desire to "not be so complicated" and "leave things as they are". The battles
we see in society today are those who want things to be the same, and those who are constantly searching for
the new. The same goes with gender.

Lastly, I'd argue that this novel categorizing of internal expereince is a tool that was built for the internet.
This is to say that the benefits of using this type of (gender) short hand increases with the number of strangers
one spends time with or is exposed to. Given the amount of people on the internet and how estranged they are with
one another, a shorthand like "Aguaboy" becomes hugely beneficial both in communicating who you are, but also in
filtering out others you may not like or may not like you.

**MY TAKE**

As with all (Langerian-type) mindfulness, there is a benefit towards creating novel disntinctions. Indeed, saying
"I am a man" may communicate something to others that I may not really mean. Therefore, giving another 
description might be more accurate and help others to understand and treat me as such. It's obvious the 
sense of being understood that would arise in someone who knows that what happens inside them does not conform
with the categories made be their society. Even in finding the particular description or word itself
may be freeing to that person. I'd imagine that most would see this as a good thing!

Of course, the dialogue gets ruined by how people's passions get inspired with this topic. The left
focuses on potential injustices that may occur, and, likely, personal histories about not being understood,
which they project onto the other side. Meanwhile, the right focuses on the disorientation and confusion that
comes from these novel distinctions. They experience it as an attack, not just on their conceptions of who
people are, but also in what they take pride in. If being a "man" doesn't have as much baggage or constriction 
as it used to be, then what does this mean for all the identity building they've done and esteem they recieved 
based on how much of a "man" they were? Surely, it wouldn't have as much importance.

Simply put, the right does not feel the same excitement and freedom from the novel distinction making that
the left does. Freedom for some is desolation for others.

Importantly, human beings are adaptive and shocking things rarely stay shocking for long. We see this to be
the case with gay marriage. Previously, it was a revolutionary concept which prompted much disgust from certain 
individuals. Now, it is remarkably accepted. We don't hold on to disgust very long, and this is why the left 
appears to win the long game when it comes to social issues. What the left could do for the short term however,
is let go of the "save the world" narrative and instead understand and empathize with the fear which the right
experiences these sudden changes. Moreover, if we let go of the save the world narrative and understand that
lasting change only occurs gradually, some of the very sudden changes can be forgone. The left has its own 
lessons  to learn about cohesion and belonging, something the right knows intimately.
