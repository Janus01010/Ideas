What if the solution to the homeless problem is actually found by LESS empathy?

When we see homeless people, most of us are horrified and basically flooded with emotions of guilt, disgust, sorrow, concern, and anger. 
These emotions often prime us to take immediate action (oh no, a tiger is coming, RUN!!), however, with a socio-political issue like homelessness, 
a single person's impact on the grand problem will do practically nothing. The individual recognizes this, and therefore becomes helpless.
They can't control hopelessness, but what can they control? Whether or not they are exposed to the triggering stimulus.

We protect ourselves from the feeling of hopelessness brought about by empathy by avoiding and not thinking about the homeless.

Imagine if we were instead more emotionally cold. We wouldn't become helpless, 
and we would calmly and rationally gather perspectives and information. 
Afterwards, we will recognize: "The problem is quite big, 
and therefore requires widespread public action, 
which is best achieved through the *GRADUAL* implementation of X, Y, and Z". 
Importantly, this solution is NOT emotionally satisfying. However, if we wait for the emotionally satisfying solution, 
we will be waiting forever.

Additional:

The greater the population size, the greater the benefits of calm, cool cognition, 
and the greater the costs of intense, hot cognition/emotion both positive AND negative.
In light of this, we'd benefit a lot from having mindfulness be the new standard when it comes to acting in our
relatively novel/new environment (i.e. neoliberal, post-modern, over populated nation states).

It's also apparent that our environment is training us to be emotionally hot and mindless in the ways discussed above
with the help of technology, however this is another matter.
