Language and memory are primarily a mechanism for INGROUP communication.
Whatever accurate/coherent relationship human language and memory has with the environment is
an UNINTENDED consequence. Like a positive externality.

They're bonding devices, and this explains why when someone does not speak the same way you do (i.e. different assumptions/world view), 
or recounts the past in a different way than you do, what follows is great frustration and basically the desire to attack the other side.
I claim that this is an evolutionary mechanism. Wrong memories or language = a severe break from the tribe. Not good for yourself or
the group. And we see this tribal disgust happening today online.

These days, you have memory and language WITHOUT ingroups.
In fact, the majority of conversation that is had is done with others that do not share your world view. The result is boring,
trite conversation that connects nobody.

This explains why, in popular american fashion, more emphasis is placed on partying, drinking, or other recreational activities,
instead of sharing ideas and ones personality with the other person. The other person shares nothing with you,
therefore the building of a relationship through conversation is not meaningful or desired.
